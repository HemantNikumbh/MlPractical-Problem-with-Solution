ML Pactical problems
1 Create a multiple linear regression model for house price dataset divide dataset into 
train and test data while giving it to model and predict prices of house.  

2 Use dataset crash.csv is an accident survivor’s dataset portal for USA hosted by 
data.gov. The dataset contains passengers age and speed of vehicle (mph) at the time 
of impact and fate of passengers (1 for survived and 0 for not survived) after a crash. 
use logistic regression to decide if the age and speed can predict the survivability of 
the passengers. 

3 Fit the simple linear regression and polynomial linear regression models to 
Salary_positions.csv data. Find which one is more accurately fitting to the given data. 
Also predict the salaries of level 11 and level 12 employees. 

4 Write a python program to categorize the given news text into one of the available 20 
categories of news groups, using multinomial Naïve Bayes machine learning model. 

5 Implement Ridge Regression, Lasso regression, ElasticNet model using 
boston_houses.csv and take only ‘RM’ and ‘Price’ of the houses. divide the data as 
training and testing data. Fit line using Ridge regression and to find price of a house if 
it contains 5 rooms. and compare results. 

6 Write a python program to Implement Decision Tree classifier model onData which is 
extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like 
specimens. 
(refer UCI dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication) 

7 Classify the iris flowers dataset using SVM and find out the flower type depending on 
the given input data like sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width Find 
accuracy of all SVM kernels.

8 Create KNN model on Indian diabetes patient’s database and predict whether a new 
patient is diabetic (1) or not (0). Find optimal value of K. 

9 Implement Non-linear regression model (Decision Tree,SVM,KNN)to predict the 
consumption of petrol use petrolconsumption 
dataset.(https://www.kaggle.com/code/ajinkyaa/linear-regression-petrol-consumption) 

10 Take iris flower dataset and reduce 4D data to 2D data using PCA. Then train the 
model and predict new flower with given measurements
